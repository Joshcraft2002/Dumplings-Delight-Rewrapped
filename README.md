<summary>Known Issues</summary>

- Pork Celery Dumpling recipe visible on JEI, but uncraftable
  - The recipe needs celery from any mod that adds it, but the original Dumplings Delight didn't. A standalone celery crop for DD:R is planned.
- Farmers don't pick up and replant fennel, garlic, chive, and chinese cabbage seeds
  - This addon was created before Farmer's Delight made their crops replantable by villagers. This feature will be added soon.
